# Coverage and execution ledger

The five DEP tabs remain read-only. The user-approved stack is #14879
(DIS-2941: shared vLLM/SGLang CPU foundation), #15243 (DIS-2942: common/vLLM
units beside production), then #15091 (DIS-2943: additional vLLM wire, process
and native integration). #15089 remains a separate unit-layout comparison;
#15088 is superseded. The foundation is based on main
`4a0547f8ba2675f14d50e48d6aec53b1bc3cf3e3`; vLLM 0.29.0 and protocol 0.3.0 remain pinned.
Each integration head requires its own validation.

## Retained foundation and isolated units

#14879 owns four shared families for both vLLM and SGLang: streaming/terminal
usage/replay; opening/EOF/read failure and delivered prefix; cancellation before
submission/during opening/during read with independent-request survival; and
cleanup. #15091's nine vLLM wire scenarios incorporate those four vLLM families,
not an additional duplicate enrollment. Its four SGLang foundation cases remain.

#15243 owns the full R01–R32 mapping and pure assertion relocations in
[UNITS.md](UNITS.md). Shared production units run once; new backend units are
vLLM-only. The no-I/O before-start/idempotent-cleanup subsection moves only for
vLLM; SGLang retains its original subsection. Both backends retain active-stream
cleanup, cancelled terminal/usage and remote release at the wire boundary.

The isolated suite contains 82 cases: 11 common and 71 vLLM, using ordinary
`#[test]` and `#[tokio::test]` attributes. They run with the normal workspace
command and nightly Rust coverage. There is no unit lane macro or shared unit
adapter. Native fixtures live in the vLLM crate, without a testkit
dev-dependency. #15243 retains 37 broader vLLM library cases; this integration
boundary consolidates three wire cases into conformance, leaving 34 there.

Both Mocker suites retain all four cases through #15243. At the integration
boundary, the two distinct vLLM manual-handoff/KV-relay cases and all four SGLang
Mocker cases remain. SGLang's incremental logprobs/usage, prefill/decode,
Abort release, request isolation and shutdown assertions are not replaced by
vLLM tests. Existing TensorRT-LLM, shared-production and E2E ownership remains.

## vLLM wire coverage owned by #15091

The following maps all distinct assertions from the prior wire increment to
its new integration owner. All nine cases were collected and passed in the
historical integration candidate based on #15089 `b3ab1638`, with zero ignored.
That execution predates this restack onto #15243 and does not validate its new head.

| DEP IDs / prior assertions | Owning boundary and new case | Disposition / execution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R09/C4; old `sidecar_streams_mocker_tokens_logprobs_and_usage` | CPU wire `streaming::vllm_tokens_terminal_logprobs_and_usage` | Adds full native token/text/selected and alternative logprob values, prompt logprob values, exact terminal and all usage fields, nondefault request fields, and ignored post-terminal replay. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| R11/C6/C7 | CPU wire `errors::vllm_open_failure_early_eof_and_read_failure` | Typed open/read Unavailable, early EOF Unknown, exact emitted prefix, no false success, remote drop, subsequent healthy request on same engine. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| C6 native rejection; old `grpc_request_errors_are_propagated` | CPU wire `errors::vllm_native_rejection_recovers_on_same_engine` | Real Mocker admission rejects oversized output before a response stream opens; InvalidArgument and exact native reason survive; following request succeeds. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| C7 malformed native terminal | CPU wire `errors::vllm_malformed_terminal_fails_then_recovers` | Scripted token then invalid native enum; exact prefix, protocol Unknown, no successful completion, recovery. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| R12/R14/C8; old `cancellation_interrupts_pending_response_headers`, `cancellation_drops_the_remote_stream` | CPU wire `cancellation::vllm_cancellation_before_open_during_open_and_during_read` | Before-open no submission, held headers drop, independently paused concurrent streams on a two-connection pool; cancellation A leaves B pending and B completes; same-engine healthy follow-up. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| C8; old `dropping_sidecar_stream_cancels_mocker_work` (actually explicit stop) | CPU wire `cancellation::vllm_explicit_cancel_releases_active_scheduler_work` | Observe nonterminal output and active scheduler first; exactly cancelled terminal with partial usage, route release and zero running/waiting scheduler work, healthy follow-up. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| C9 | CPU wire `cancellation::vllm_consumer_drop_releases_active_scheduler_work` | Drop live consumer without stop or Abort; observe active scheduler first, then remote drop and zero running/waiting scheduler work, healthy follow-up. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| R13 direct cleanup | CPU wire `lifecycle::vllm_cleanup_during_read_and_post_cleanup_admission` | Live-stream cancellation and post-cleanup generation cannot submit native work; #15243 moves only vLLM before-start error and repeatable cleanup into isolated coverage; SGLang retains its foundation checks. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| C7 peer termination; framework bounded teardown | CPU wire `lifecycle::vllm_teardown_terminates_handlers_with_clients_alive` | Abruptly terminate dedicated native server runtime while real engine and stream objects remain alive; join runtime, observe handler and scheduler release, exact prefix plus typed failure. Historical vLLM run passed; earlier #15091 candidate also collected and passed, 0 ignored. |
| Native request cache namespace, structured outputs, metadata/KV sources, engine config; connection reuse; opaque prefill/decode; EPD; RL/LoRA | Existing vLLM socket tests | Retained. Broad old aggregate test has distinct assertions beyond shared C4. |
| Mocker prefill/decode opaque handoff and KV relay/indexer | Existing `lib/mocker/servers/vllm/tests/sidecar.rs` | Retained: opaque manual handoff and KV relay/indexer have distinct assertions. |
| SGLang foundation and Mocker suites; TensorRT-LLM owning suites | Existing owners | Retain the four SGLang conformance cases and all four SGLang Mocker cases; no new backend activation or migration. |
| Actual engine compute release / KV transfer | #15091 explicit native target | Cannot be established by CPU Mocker scheduler or fake handoff. |
| Existing E2E allocation | Root Python suites/workflows | Unchanged per current rollout. |

## Replacement accounting

These five replacements belong only to #15091. Preserve and validate every
listed assertion before removing its original definition; shared-family
refactoring must also retain the existing SGLang assertions.

| Original definition | Replacement boundary and distinct assertions |
| --- | --- |
| `grpc_request_errors_are_propagated` | Native rejection wire scenario: `generate()` returns a setup error before opening a response stream, preserving native RPC/code/reason and typed category; handler release and recovery also pass. Unit status tables do not replace transport propagation. |
| `cancellation_drops_the_remote_stream` | Wire cancellation: remote context/drop, exact delivered prefix and cancelled terminal/usage. |
| `cancellation_interrupts_pending_response_headers` | Held-header wire cancellation: vLLM `generate()` itself stays pending before headers, cancellation completes without manually releasing them, and the native handler is dropped. SGLang retains its lazy-stream contract. |
| `sidecar_streams_mocker_tokens_logprobs_and_usage` | vLLM streaming wire: exact native token/text values, one-token native delta assertions where specific to vLLM, three candidate entries, selected/top values, prompt metadata, terminal and usage; generic shared assertions remain chunk-size independent. |
| `dropping_sidecar_stream_cancels_mocker_work` | Explicit-stop wire scenario: this old test called Stop; retain that behavior and add independently observed active scheduler drain. Pure consumer drop is a distinct added case. |

Richer aggregate mapping, native metadata, decode first-token cancellation,
media, LoRA, RL, opaque handoff and KV-relay assertions remain. Pure unit
relocation is recorded in UNITS.md and is not deletion of coverage.

## Process and native boundaries

[PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) preserves all six Worker/real-sidecar/PrefillRouter
scenarios, runtime regression assertions and failure classifications.
[NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md) preserves real-engine compatibility, cancellation and
positive-transfer requirements. CPU scheduling or opaque handoff forwarding
cannot establish real GPU-work release or actual NIXL transfer.
The pinned native handoff defect, transfer-time cancellation and required
two-GPU success topology remain blocked; #15091 is not merge-ready on CPU
results alone. [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) retains all 162 capability IDs and both
unnumbered restrictions; [DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md) records departures.

## Validation commands

The ordinary workspace command, `cargo test --locked --all-targets`, runs the
unit and wire suites without custom selectors. Process and native commands are
in [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) and [NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md). Direct wire commands,
including retained SGLang coverage, are:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-testkit --test conformance -- --list
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-testkit --test conformance
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-vllm-mocker --test sidecar
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sglang-mocker --test sidecar
cargo clippy --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-testkit --test conformance --no-deps -- -D warnings
```

## Local validation of the #15243 restack

The integration candidate merges `bdf5b5ee65` with unit head `40c329fe2b`.
The following checks executed locally before assigning a final merge commit:

| Selection | Passed |
| --- | ---: |
| Shared conformance | 13: nine vLLM and four SGLang |
| Retained Mocker suites | Six: two vLLM and four SGLang |
| Process suite with the rebuilt real sidecar executable | Six, in 22.42 seconds |
| Common/vLLM all-targets | 119: 13 common library, 105 vLLM library and one CLI case |
| Testkit controller regression | One |
| Runtime cancellation before response setup and media-retention guard | Three |

All listed tests passed with zero failures or ignored cases. The library row
includes all 82 isolated units and the 34 retained cases in `vllm/src/tests.rs`;
those are not additional executions. Formatting, pre-commit, workflow YAML,
shell syntax and testkit Clippy for all process/native targets passed, with
Clippy warnings denied. Full-workspace tests, current-head GitHub CI and
GPU/native-engine execution are not claimed. The native-transfer blockers
remain as recorded in [NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md).

The workflow's native build, JSON artifact selection and stripped executable
export passed; the exported binary listed all three native cases. Listing
does not execute those GPU scenarios.

## Historical validation before the #15243 restack

#14879 at `286d6fd5bbfe10efb9c929edca6c3185032b84cc` passed eight
shared and eight retained Mocker cases locally, and Clippy passed. Its exact
trusted copy activated full PR run 35791357457 and Pre Merge 35791350230;
the initial CI snapshot was still pending. Refreshed #15089 at
`b3ab1638513e255828acddc40f045d069ed6bc33` passed 62 isolated cases in the
CPU container, 102 total common/vLLM library cases, eight conformance cases and
eight retained Mocker cases. Formatting, Clippy, pre-commit and ownership checks
passed. The 62 isolated cases are part of the 102-library selection, not an
additional set. [UNITS.md](UNITS.md) owns revision-specific unit evidence, including the later
82-case suite. These historical counts are not the restacked suite inventory.

### Earlier integration execution on the refreshed main base

The #15091 candidate based on `b3ab1638513e255828acddc40f045d069ed6bc33`,
including the strengthened native-rejection setup and held-header cancellation
assertions above, passed the isolated CPU artifact run. This is candidate-source
evidence on refreshed main `4a0547f8`, not a final integration commit or CI result.

| Collected and executed selection | Passed | Ignored |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Common/vLLM isolated units | 11 + 51 = 62 | 0 |
| vLLM/SGLang shared conformance | 9 + 4 = 13 | 0 |
| Retained vLLM/SGLang Mocker cases | 2 + 4 = 6 | 0 |
| Retained common/vLLM library wire cases | 2 + 35 = 37 | 0 |
| Actual-sidecar process integration | 6 | 0 |
| Complete CPU selection | **124** | **0** |

The 56 wire cases are the three middle rows. Unlike the overlapping historical
library selections, these runner selections are disjoint. The separate
`--framework vllm --level all --list` artifact collection returned 116 cases,
excluding the eight retained SGLang cases; it is not a second execution.

The removed Python runner and CPU-container exporter produced that historical
selection. Current execution uses the direct Cargo commands above and the
feature-gated process/native commands in their owning reports.

That historical runner listed each selection before executing it and rejected failures,
ignored cases or count mismatches. Recorded artifacts are
`restack/integration-container.log`, `restack/integration-vllm-collection.log`,
and `restack/integration-clippy.log` in the separate execution report. Clippy
passed in 1 minute 6 seconds; formatting passed. [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md)
records the additional runtime checks. Refreshed native execution collected
three cases: compatibility and cancellation passed; handoff failed on the
pinned upstream defect, with zero decode tokens and no completed transfer.
[NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md) records the result and unexecuted two-GPU/transfer-time
cancellation requirements. Final current-head CI remains pending.

## Historical execution on the superseded stack

Historical #15088 at `73192d69351b51763a018edc75b7ec275d9fa68a` used main
`cdcd721e`. Its nine vLLM conformance and two remaining vLLM Mocker cases passed
inside a CPU container with `--network none`, no GPU/model cache or engine
installation. The retained vLLM library suite passed 60 cases. These counts
exclude the newly retained foundation SGLang cases and are not the refreshed
stack's collection. Historical #15089 and #15091 results are labeled in their
layer reports; old green CI covers only the recorded old heads.

The initial historical wire run passed 8/9. The failed harness expectation
assumed `CannotConnect` after abrupt HTTP/2 shutdown; actual transport returned
`Unknown`. Corrected assertions still required exact prefix, one typed error,
RPC context, no successful terminal, handler drop and scheduler release. No
production fix was needed for this expectation. Historical corrected conformance
and Mocker runs passed 9/9 in 1.81 seconds and 2/2 in 0.68 seconds, respectively.

The historical exporter initially selected a non-test helper executable as a
duplicate. Selecting Cargo's test profile and exact target corrected that
harness defect; manifests reject missing or duplicate targets. Source inspection
and intended CI allocation never count as execution.
