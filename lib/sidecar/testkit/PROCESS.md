# vLLM process and handoff integration

[#15091](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/15091) adds process/handoff
integration after #14879's shared foundation and #15243's local units, on
refreshed main `4a0547f8ba2675f14d50e48d6aec53b1bc3cf3e3`. vLLM 0.29.0 and native
protocol 0.3.0 remain pinned. The historical integration candidate based on #15089
`b3ab1638513e255828acddc40f045d069ed6bc33` collected and passed all six process
cases in the isolated CPU container, with zero ignored. Those results and the
runtime results below predate this restack and keep their original attribution.
Final current-head CI remains pending.

CPU results do not establish real-engine compatibility, GPU work release or KV
transfer. [NATIVE.md](NATIVE.md) retains historical cancellation/compatibility
passes and the unresolved pinned-engine handoff blocker.

The #15243 unit boundary at `40c329fe2b` passed its common/vLLM tests, as
recorded in [UNITS.md](UNITS.md). Those results do not execute this integration
layer. Process tests still require the `process-tests` feature and run after
merge and nightly; they introduce no per-test Rust lane markers.

## Production boundaries

`tests/support/process.rs` owns child process groups, bounded exit and kill/reap
fallback, captured logs, temporary model/tokenizer metadata, a unique discovery
namespace, and dynamic ports. It uses production file discovery, TCP request
transport and ZMQ events without external NATS, etcd, model downloads or GPUs.
A controlled TCP gate observes real connection attempts before allowing native
startup. Each scenario has a 60-second outer deadline and bounded phase waits.

The native peers reuse the wire suite's fixture and request controls. Tests call
the published Worker endpoint. Handoff tests instantiate the real Dynamo
`PrefillRouter`, which discovers and dispatches to two actual sidecar processes.
They bypass the HTTP frontend because HTTP parsing and text generation belong
to the preserved E2E suite.

The five common startup, registration, ingress, cancellation and shutdown
scenario bodies are generic over `ProcessFixture`, which extends the wire
suite's `WireFixture`, which extends `SidecarFixture`. The vLLM process profile
supplies the executable, native endpoint, supported request options and exact
discovered capacity
assertions. Common lifecycle assertions remain in reusable scenario bodies.
Only the handoff case inspects vLLM protobuf fields directly: its native
prefill/decode metadata is a backend-specific contract.

All new process fixtures instantiate vLLM only. The four existing SGLang wire
scenarios and four SGLang Mocker cases remain in their original CPU layer.
Shared runtime production regressions run once in the runtime crate. No new
SGLang/TensorRT-LLM process or native activation is added; existing E2E
allocation remains unchanged.

## Coverage and ownership

| Process test | DEP requirement | Observable guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `vllm_registration_and_errors_recover_through_worker_ingress` | C1/C4/C5/C6/C7 | Exact model, role, context, DP and capacity metadata; tokenizer/formatter publication; absent unsupported parser names; nondefault sampling and logprob options survive real Worker ingress with exact native request, output and usage. Unsupported `n=2` yields a typed invalid-argument cause without native submission. Native opening failure, midstream failure and missing terminal preserve their typed error and exact prefix; the same child serves a valid request after each failure. |
| `vllm_delayed_startup_publishes_only_after_native_readiness` | C2 | An observed native connection attempt remains gated while discovery has no model or serving endpoint. Releasing the gate allows readiness and successful endpoint generation. Uses the environment endpoint option; other scenarios use CLI wiring. |
| `vllm_failed_and_interrupted_startup_leave_no_registration` | C3/C10 | Refused connection, accepted connection without RPC response, and SIGTERM during startup all exit within bounds without publishing a usable endpoint. |
| `vllm_worker_cancel_and_consumer_drop_release_only_the_target` | C8/C9 | Explicit cancellation during native opening or after a token reaches the correct remote request. Pure consumer stream drop releases remote work without the caller explicitly cancelling. An independently accepted request continues with exact tokens/usage, and the next request succeeds. Active Mocker scheduler work is observed before cancellation and drains afterward. |
| `vllm_sigterm_withdraws_worker_and_releases_active_native_request` | C10 | Actual endpoint withdrawal, router exclusion and refusal of new requests precede native cleanup and process exit during the configured grace period. An active native request is released, scheduler work drains, the child exits successfully, and the independent native peer remains usable. |
| `vllm_prefill_router_preserves_handoff_failure_and_cancellation` | C11/C12 CPU | The real PrefillRouter uses advertised prefill/decode roles; preserves correlated opaque handoff fields and normalizes `remote_port`; returns decode tokens/usage without leaking prefill tokens; prevents decode submission after failed prefill; cancels after both peers accept but before decode produces its first token; drains both peers and serves a following handoff. |

Existing conversion/configuration assertions remain in their unit owners. Native
connection-loss and malformed-terminal faults remain in the CPU wire suite.
The existing manually chained vLLM Mocker handoff and distinct vLLM adapter
handoff assertions are retained. Shared Worker lifecycle and adapter semantics
remain in `dynamo-backend-common`, credited once. [COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md)
contains the broader preservation mapping; [DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md) records
changes from the read-only DEP.

## Historical failures reproduced and corrected

These reproductions belong to the superseded stack ending at `9bcc0773`. The
regression assertions passed again on the refreshed integration candidate; no
new pre-fix failure reproduction is claimed from this report update.

| Failure | Classification | Correction and regression |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cancelling while native response headers were held timed out; independently reproduced against the frozen pre-fix binary in 10.35 seconds | Production defect | TCP response setup waited for the response prologue before forwarding cancellation. The runtime now observes Stop, Kill and provider drop during that wait, forwards the correct control and releases setup. `test_response_stream_cancellation_before_prologue` checks all three controls, including that Stop never becomes Kill. The process cancellation scenario proves native handler release and independent-request survival. |
| The first correction delivered cancellation but the caller received CannotConnect, temporarily excluding the healthy worker from routing | Production defect | The addressed router now returns an empty stream with the original cancelled context when the local response provider fails. Existing remote migration-error classification stays unchanged. Both process cancellation and cancelled-handoff recovery exercise this correction. |
| The original #15091's typed Cancelled setup error failed four existing Python cancellation cases on both CI architectures | Stack regression | Existing callers expect `generate()` to return an empty stream after local cancellation. The corrected adapter preserves that contract; both process scenarios now require successful stream setup instead of accepting an exception. The existing Python assertions remain unchanged. |
| Early pre-prologue cancellation could release an existing frontend media-retention guard before the worker used its source buffer | Stack regression | Only a dispatch that owns the taken first-response guard defers early Stop/Kill until the prologue, preserving its original setup behavior. Ordinary sidecar requests retain early cancellation. A real router/TCP regression reproduces premature guard release when protection is disabled. Existing post-prologue cancellation behavior is unchanged. |
| Shutdown waited for every persistent model card to disappear | Harness defect | The actual Worker contract withdraws serving endpoints. The test now reads authoritative discovery, observes exclusion in the existing router, rejects new requests and verifies withdrawal precedes cleanup/exit. It does not infer worker liveness from persistent metadata. |
| A setup error was expected only inside an already-open stream | Harness defect | Accept the real pre-stream error return and assert its exact semantic type through the runtime's existing cause chain. Stream failures retain exact prefix and typed terminal assertions. |
| Immediate retry selected no worker after an injected connection failure | Harness defect | Await the router's actual availability through its existing five-second inhibition period; preserve fault detection and assert successful reuse. |
| DEP parser metadata and startup assumptions did not match the chosen base | Refreshed support evidence | vLLM now uses Control metadata and health discovery. Parser flags remain unsupported and are rejected before discovery by retained isolated tests; process metadata must not advertise them. |

The initial full execution reported 1 passed/5 failed; after correcting the
first harness defects and TCP forwarding, it reported 3 passed/3 failed. No
failed assertion was converted to a skip. The historical final run included the
necessary production fixes and all six enabled scenarios.

## Validation commands and remaining work

From the repository root, with the Rust/protobuf build prerequisites installed:

```bash
cargo build --locked -p dynamo-vllm-sidecar --bin dynamo-vllm-sidecar
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-testkit --features process-tests --test cross_process -- --list
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-testkit --features process-tests --test cross_process -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
cargo clippy --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-testkit --features process-tests --test cross_process -- -D warnings
```

The fixture finds the sidecar beside the test target's `debug` directory.
Set `DYNAMO_VLLM_SIDECAR` to an absolute executable path when using separate
build directories. Use the same `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` and protobuf compiler for
building the binary and tests.

The current restack's six process cases passed with the rebuilt sidecar in
22.42 seconds; [COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md#local-validation-of-the-15243-restack)
records that candidate and the accompanying checks.

## Historical candidate execution before the #15243 restack

These results belong to the #15091 candidate based on `b3ab1638`, with refreshed
main `4a0547f8` and its updated shared dependencies. They do not identify a final
integration commit or establish current-head CI coverage.

| Check | Refreshed result |
| --- | --- |
| Actual-sidecar process suite | All 6 cases collected and executed in the isolated CPU container; 6 passed, 0 ignored, 22.46 seconds |
| Pre-prologue regression filter | `test_response_stream_cancellation_before_prologue` and existing QUIC `bundle_failure_before_prologue_resolves_pending_provider`: 2 passed, 0 ignored, 0.08 seconds |
| Guarded setup | `first_response_guard_defers_tcp_cancellation_until_prologue`: 1 passed, 0 ignored, 0.21 seconds |
| Broader TCP tests | Serial selection: 82 passed, 0 ignored, 0.31 seconds; includes the focused TCP cancellation case |
| Complete CPU artifact selection | 124 passed, 0 ignored: 62 units + 56 wire + 6 process; detailed disjoint selection in COVERAGE.md |
| Integration/runtime Clippy and formatting | All testkit targets with `process-tests,native-tests` passed Clippy with `-D warnings`; runtime library/tests Clippy also passed in 40.22 seconds; formatting passed |
| Native and CI | Refreshed native compatibility/cancellation passed; handoff failed on the pinned upstream defect. Final current-head CI is pending; transfer-time cancellation and required two-GPU evidence remain blocked (NATIVE.md) |

The runtime selections overlap and must not be added. Their focused filters can
be rerun with:

```bash
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-runtime --lib before_prologue -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-runtime --lib first_response_guard_defers_tcp_cancellation_until_prologue -- --test-threads=1
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-runtime --lib pipeline::network::tcp -- --test-threads=1
cargo clippy --locked -p dynamo-runtime --lib --tests --no-deps -- -D warnings
```

The separate execution report contains `restack/integration-container.log`,
`restack/runtime-cancel.log`, `restack/runtime-guard.log`,
`restack/runtime-tcp.log`, `restack/runtime-clippy.log` and
`restack/integration-clippy.log`. CPU execution does
not certify real GPU work release or NIXL transfer.

## Historical execution on the superseded stack

All results below precede the merge-based restack and use the old `cdcd721e`
implementation base. They are not current collection or execution results.

| Check | Historical result |
| --- | --- |
| Final actual sidecar build | Passed after both cancellation corrections; 13.60-second incremental build |
| Process target compilation and execution | Final guarded-path source compiled; all 6 cases collected/executed in the isolated CPU container, 0 ignored; 22.51-second execution |
| Focused runtime cancellation regression | Passed again after guard containment; 1 test covers Stop/Kill/provider drop, 0 ignored; 0.01 seconds |
| Guarded runtime setup | Protection-disabled mutation reproduced premature guard release (1 failed, 0 ignored). Restored protection passed (1 case, 0.21 seconds); all 7 addressed-router cases passed. This protects the original pre-prologue behavior only. |
| Broader TCP server tests | 45 collected; initial parallel execution 40 passed/5 failed due to existing TLS tests mutating process environment concurrently; immediate serial execution 45 passed/0 failed/0 ignored in 0.26 seconds. This used the TCP fix before the additional addressed-router guard. |
| Process source formatting and whitespace | Passed |
| Targeted process Clippy | Final process source passed with `-D warnings` in 1 minute; runtime including tests also passed in 43.82 seconds |
| Isolated CPU container | Initial implementation: 54 collected/executed (9 conformance, 2 Mocker, 2 common transport, 35 retained vLLM socket, 6 process), all passed. After the cancellation contract correction: all 6 strengthened process cases passed again in 22.48 seconds; after guarded-path containment, all 6 passed again in 22.51 seconds. All containers disabled external networking; zero ignored. |
| Old-head CI | Historical head `9bcc0773` passed full PR run 35420262939 and Pre Merge 35420261410. Logs included the guard regression and all four unchanged Python cancellation cases on each architecture. New-head CI is pending. |
| Pinned native-engine compatibility/cancellation/handoff | Cancellation passed; native handoff executed and failed due to the upstream float conversion described in NATIVE.md. CPU Mocker evidence is not credited as native transfer. |

The `cross_process` target requires the `process-tests` feature for the
framework's post-merge CPU lane. Default CPU unit/wire tests remain pre-merge;
existing E2E tests and GPU lanes are preserved. An intended lane or a collected
test is not execution evidence; pending validation is not complete.
