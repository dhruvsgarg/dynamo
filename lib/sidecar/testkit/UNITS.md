# Isolated unit coverage (DIS-2942)

[#15243](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/15243) supplies the unit layer
in the approved [#14879](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/14879) →
[#15243](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/15243) →
[#15091](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/15091) stack. The original
[#15089](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/15089) remains a separate
layout comparison. The foundation uses main
`4a0547f8ba2675f14d50e48d6aec53b1bc3cf3e3`. Pinned versions remain vLLM 0.29.0
(`98dff2a81d747d1dba01a47f939f48c3526d4206`) and `vllm-proto` 0.3.0.
The source matrix used older Dynamo snapshots and vLLM 0.28.0. Current native
Control discovery, health, metadata, multimodal forwarding, LoRA, Encode, RL
administration, priority and rank selection are supported and retain their
existing assertions. The DEP and its five tabs remain read-only; departures are
recorded separately in [DEVIATIONS.md](DEVIATIONS.md).

Tests live beside production as ordinary `#[cfg(test)]` child modules. They use
no sockets, processes, engines or model downloads. The common suite runs once,
and the vLLM suite calls its private production functions directly. SGLang
units remain follow-up work. The existing shared wire suite still runs both
backends, both retained Mocker suites remain, and E2E allocation is unchanged.
Additional wire, process and native integration belong to
[#15091](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/pull/15091), as mapped in
[COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md).

## Source ownership

The former `testkit/tests/unit/` tree and its source-group/setup macros are
removed. Each test keeps its inputs, production calls and assertions beside
the code it exercises. Private production functions remain private;
relocating the tests changes no production behavior.

```

| Source | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [Common args][args], [endpoints][endpoints], [errors][errors] | Defaults/validation and status mapping beside their production implementations. |
| [Common transport][transport] | Retry/pool policy with paused time; one registration avoids duplicate collection through `transport.rs`'s Tonic-version include. |
| [Model][config], [worker][worker], [JSON][json], [LoRA][lora] | Local production calls, setup and assertions for each vLLM owner. |
| [Request units][requests], [response units][responses] | Larger conversion suites in adjacent files included by `convert.rs`. |
| [`src/fixtures.rs`](src/fixtures.rs) | Shared integration input builders and output collection. |
| [`vllm/src/test_fixtures.rs`](../vllm/src/test_fixtures.rs) | Native request, model, response, media and handoff builders, including `minimal_request()`, reused by vLLM unit and retained wire tests. |

Inline unit modules use ordinary `tests` names; `convert.rs` declares
`request_tests` and `response_tests` without custom paths. Common transport
keeps its explicit one-time registration. There are no shared unit scenarios
or backend adapters. The ten formerly shared vLLM scenarios remain local,
with unchanged inputs/assertions:

| Local owner | Preserved scenarios |
| --- | --- |
| Requests | Oversized logprob rejection, selected LoRA forwarding, prefill/decode rank selection and fallback. |
| Responses | Prompt-logprob opt-in/positions/values and terminal-reason preservation through real conversion helpers. |
| Model | Model identity/limits, absent optional limits and logical block size/per-rank capacity. |
| Worker | Worker options/model identity and generation/cleanup before startup. |

Native builders belong to the vLLM crate under `#[cfg(test)]`; moving
`minimal_request()` there removes its dev-dependency on testkit. No testing
feature is added. Shared integration scenarios keep their separate testkit
helpers and backend adapters.

## Ordinary Rust tests and Cargo execution

Isolated tests use ordinary `#[test]` or `#[tokio::test]` attributes:

```rust
#[test]
fn preserves_request_fields() {
    // Scenario assertions.
}
```

The suite contains **82 isolated cases: 11 common and 71 vLLM**. It preserves
the prior 81 scenarios and moves the existing LoRA lock-registry test from
`vllm/src/tests.rs` into `lora.rs::tests`, with its inputs and assertions intact.
At the #15243 boundary, the broader file retains 37 tests; #15091 consolidates
three wire cases into conformance and retains 34. The LoRA move is one
reclassified test, not new coverage. The ten formerly shared vLLM scenarios remain local: three request,
two response, three model and two worker cases.

CI runs `cargo test --locked --all-targets` in each Rust workspace. All unit
tests run on pull requests and pushes; nightly Rust coverage also runs them.
There are no per-test lane declarations, lane macros, custom filters or
separate package invocations. The Python runner, inventory, manifest/export
modes and additional CPU-container job are removed. Common/vLLM library runs
include their retained fake-server tests as well as the isolated cases.

#15091 uses these ordinary unit tests without `unit_` or lane-based selectors.
Its CPU integration workflow invokes Cargo directly. Process tests retain their
`process-tests` feature; the native workflow exports only the `native_engine`
artifact for the existing GPU launcher. Those feature gates keep integration
scheduling separate from always-on units.

## Deferred SGLang units

Future SGLang units should live beside their production owners with local
fixtures. Shared scenarios remain an integration concern. Existing SGLang model,
rank-fallback and other assertions must be preserved before any old test is removed. Its live response
conversion stays at the integration boundary unless a callable production
helper provides an isolated boundary. Worker construction currently performs
bootstrap I/O; a private in-memory construction seam is separate follow-up work.

Typed gRPC and opaque HTTP paths have distinct contracts: typed gRPC rejects
seed, nonzero priority and some guide forms; the HTTP envelope forwards native
sampling fields and represents priority differently. Special-token policy,
cache controls, invalid top-k, orphan media identifiers and conflicting guides
need their own assertions. These are unexecuted parity observations, not
confirmed user-facing failures. Early bootstrap handoff also needs its own
protocol assertions rather than vLLM's completed-prefill expectation.

## R01–R32 mapping

Each row credits retained assertions before additions. File links identify the
executable owner; deferred scenarios do not count as executed coverage.

| ID | Retained coverage, additions or justified disposition | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R01 | Move existing endpoint authority, scheme, IPv6 and HTTP checks unchanged. | [Common endpoints][endpoints] |
| R02 | Move common defaults, overrides and zero rejection; defer new SGLang clamp cases. | [Common arguments][args] |
| R03 | Retain discovery/config checks; add exact WorkerConfig fields, model identity, parser and Encode rejection through production `from_discovered`. | [Worker][worker] and [model configuration][config]; retained bootstrap sockets |
| R04 | Execute the actual retry policy with virtual time: first failure/retry, all pool slots, one absolute deadline, bounded attempt/sleep and retained peer cause. | [Common transport][transport]; existing connection sockets |
| R05 | Move and extend the status table to all 17 codes, categories, RPC/code/message text and both tonic versions. | [Common errors][errors] |
| R06 | Move exact nondefault native field assertions from the aggregate socket test; add optional/zero/false sentinels, deduplicated stop IDs and top-k boundaries. Keep gRPC metadata and outputs in wire tests. | [Requests][requests] |
| R07 | Retain existing logprob/media/Encode rejections; add supported/default versus unsupported generation, thinking, media, overrides and cache-input cases. Preserve no-RPC admission checks. | [Requests][requests]; [retained socket tests][legacy] |
| R08 | Assert exact guide types/payloads and conflict, backend and whitespace rejection. | [Requests][requests] |
| R09 | Exercise real ResponseState empty messages, delta tokens, empty engine text, terminal and usage. Actual generate-loop termination stays in wire tests. | [Responses][responses]; [streaming wire][streaming] |
| R10 | Check typed malformed sequence/count/finish/logprob/prompt metadata failures. Real stream termination after conversion failure belongs to the additional wire coverage in #15091. | [Responses][responses]; [error wire][wire-errors] |
| R11 | Keep open/read/EOF and postterminal consumption at the real generation boundary; do not copy its loop into units. | [Error wire][wire-errors], [streaming wire][streaming] |
| R12 | Keep cancellation and remote release at wire level, including decode's first-token safeguard. | [Cancellation wire][cancellation]; [retained decode sockets][legacy] |
| R13 | Add vLLM unstarted generation and idempotent cleanup; remove only its matching wire subsection after replacement validation. Preserve SGLang's original subsection and both backends' active cleanup. Post-cleanup admission additions belong to #15091. | [Worker cases][worker], [lifecycle wire][lifecycle] |
| R14 | Concurrent identity and cancellation isolation use the shared wire scenario, without a duplicate backend unit loop. | [Cancellation wire][cancellation] |
| R15 | Retain selected-only logprobs; add exact multi-token selected/top IDs, ranks, values, opt-in and alignment. | [Responses][responses] |
| R16 | Retain prompt-metadata timing; add exact first-position null, selected/alternate payload and terminal-only opt-in. | [Responses][responses] |
| R17 | Add user string/token, system EOS and hidden-token overlap table; fix exposed system-only stop reasons. | [Responses][responses] |
| R18 | vLLM releases GenerateStream; it has no targeted Abort RPC to test. Explicit-RPC fixtures for other backends are deferred; R12 remains required. | [Cancellation wire][cancellation] |
| R19 | Retain opaque/repeated handoff sockets; add decode precedence, port normalization, malformed/missing payload, prefill suppression/usage and failed-prefill no-handoff. | [Requests][requests], [responses][responses]; retained handoff sockets; process/native additions in #15091 |
| R20 | Assert current canonical prefixed cache identity, no model-checksum fallback, bypass precedence and redundant-input consistency. | [Requests][requests] |
| R21 | Move existing JSON cases; add signed integer limits, fractions and nested nonfinite incoming values. | [JSON conversion][json] |
| R22 | Retain negative-infinity normalization; add NaN, positive infinity and finite-underflow association checks. | [Responses][responses] |
| R23 | Defer new SGLang JSON discovery fixtures; cover supported vLLM native identity, aliases, optional metadata and startup compatibility. | [Model config][config] |
| R24 | Retain vLLM local ranks and capacity checks; consume authoritative effective block size with legacy fallback, without reproducing engine arithmetic. Stock 0.29 producer limitation remains below. | [Model configuration/ranks][config] |
| R25 | Defer new SGLang health fixtures. Isolate vLLM incompatible local configuration; retain existing wire checks; additional process registration sequencing belongs to #15091. | [Worker config][worker]; integration |
| R26 | SGLang bootstrap-address policy is not a vLLM contract. Cover vLLM opaque port handling in R19 and roles in R03. | New SGLang cases deferred |
| R27 | SGLang room/rendezvous protocol is not a vLLM contract. Cover failed-prefill/success handoff in R19. | New SGLang cases deferred |
| R28 | Refresh stale unsupported claim: check vLLM LoRA name and role-specific DP/prefill ranks, fallback, load schema and inventory identity; retain administration sockets. | [Requests][requests], [LoRA][lora], [legacy sockets][legacy] |
| R29 | vLLM's request schema has no SGLang trace-header field. Preserve shared tracing coverage; do not invent a native field. | New SGLang cases deferred |
| R30 | Preserve existing SGLang released-protobuf tag test and CI. vLLM uses published `vllm-proto` 0.3.0. | Existing SGLang activation retained; no new backend unit cases |
| R31 | TRT mandatory max-tokens adaptation is not vLLM behavior. vLLM absent/zero sentinel forwarding is R06. | New TRT cases deferred |
| R32 | vLLM GenerateResponse has no TRT cached-token-count field; do not estimate engine cache usage. | New TRT cases deferred |

## Preserved and consolidated assertions

The original unit increment moved 21 pure definitions from
`vllm/src/tests.rs`; this cleanup moves the LoRA lock-registry unit as well. The mapping below follows their assertions to the local
production owners; renamed or split scenarios are not lost coverage. Socket
tests remain in [that file][legacy]. Rich/native builders are in
[the vLLM fixtures](../vllm/src/test_fixtures.rs), used by both layers.

| Original test | New owner |
| --- | --- |
| `lora_lock_registry_reclaims_idle_entries_without_losing_waiters` | [LoRA units][lora], preserving idle reclamation, active waiters and published locks. |
| `engine_config_advertises_supported_capabilities` | Identity, limits and native capability assertions in [model config][config]. |
| `rl_worker_metadata_identifies_zero_parallelism_dimensions` | [Model config][config] |
| `discovery_rejects_zero_data_parallelism` | [Model config][config] |
| `startup_compatibility_rejects_parallelism_change` | [Model config][config] |
| `discovery_rejects_incompatible_model_metadata` | [Model config][config] |
| `discovery_rejects_nonzero_dp_start_without_local_size` | [Model config][config] |
| `engine_config_normalizes_total_kv_blocks_per_dp_rank` | `logical_block_size_and_per_rank_capacity_are_registered` in [model cases][config]. |
| `engine_config_handles_zero_and_inexact_aggregate_kv_capacity` | [Model config][config] |
| `oversized_logprob_counts_are_rejected` | Same scenario in [request units][requests]. |
| `skip_special_tokens_is_forwarded_without_compatibility_envelope` | Direct native special-token assertions in [requests][requests]. |
| `compatibility_envelope_preserves_typed_controls` | [Requests][requests] |
| `native_sampling_is_rejected_instead_of_silently_discarded` | [Requests][requests] |
| `prefill_uses_canonical_controls_without_decode_sampling_json` | [Requests][requests] |
| `released_envelope_hydrates_kv_transfer_with_canonical_precedence` | [Requests][requests] |
| `canonical_dynamo_priority_is_converted_for_vllm` | Native priority scenario, including signed-minimum input and literal wire expectations, in [requests][requests]. |
| `unsafe_media_uuids_are_rejected` | [Requests][requests] |
| `encode_requests_reject_non_image_media` | [Requests][requests] |
| `encode_response_enforces_terminal_contract` | [Responses][responses] |
| `prompt_logprobs_are_retained_for_the_terminal_chunk` | Prompt opt-in, positions and values plus early-frame metadata checks in [responses][responses]. |
| `negative_infinity_logprobs_are_normalized` | [Responses][responses] |
| `zero_output_logprobs_omits_top_logprobs` | Native zero/absent/top-candidate assertions in [responses][responses]. |

Existing inline common argument/endpoint/error tests and vLLM JSON, rank and
[candidate extraction][requests] tests also moved to
their owning isolated modules. The broad aggregate socket test's exact request
field assertions moved into
`representative_request_preserves_all_supported_native_fields` at the previous
boundary. Its current replacements are direct native sampling, stopping and
extension-field assertions; execution evidence is recorded below.
Registration, transport DP metadata, tokens/text/logprobs and usage assertions remain at their wire boundary. No existing SGLang/TRT or
Python/E2E test is migrated or removed by this increment. The four retained
Mocker tests for each of vLLM and SGLang remain; the five additional vLLM wire
replacements are reserved for #15091, not this unit boundary.

The remaining mixed tests are split by obligation:

| Previous combined assertion | Current ownership |
| --- | --- |
| Stops, top-k, selected adapter and rank hints | Local LoRA selection, rank, stopping, top-k and Encode rank assertions in the request module. |
| Guide variants and rejected guide options | Native exact type/payload, modifier rejection and conflict scenarios. |
| Missing/malformed handoff and native port normalization | Native handoff validation, opaque payload and port-shape regressions. |
| Optional/zero request values and protobuf defaults | Direct native presence, opt-in and sentinel assertions. |
| Stream chunks, terminal reasons, stop visibility, logprob alignment and prompt metadata | Local response assertions for terminal reasons, prompt metadata, streaming conversion, stop visibility, selected/top logprobs, invalid shapes, ranks, normalization and early-frame details. |
| Worker identity/options and cleanup before startup | Local worker scenarios, parser/Encode rejection and native administration checks. |

## Pinned native limitations

vLLM 0.29.0's [`inference.proto`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/98dff2a81d747d1dba01a47f939f48c3526d4206/rust/proto/inference.proto)
defines zero max-new-tokens as a sentinel. Tests forward it without calculating
an engine default. Its [converter](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/98dff2a81d747d1dba01a47f939f48c3526d4206/rust/src/server/src/grpc/convert.rs)
forwards opaque transfer data and collapses engine Abort, Error and Repetition
into native Aborted; the sidecar cannot reconstruct those distinct causes.

`vllm-proto` 0.3.0 exposes optional `effective_attention_block_size`, but the
pinned engine's [Control producer](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/98dff2a81d747d1dba01a47f939f48c3526d4206/rust/src/server/src/grpc/control.rs)
does not supply it. The sidecar now consumes nonzero authoritative values,
falls back for absent/zero legacy values and rejects overflow. Actual DCP
metadata reporting remains an upstream blocker; isolated fixtures do not
establish native producer compatibility.

Multiple output sequences, thinking budget, decoded tensor/media inputs,
UUID-only media, remote-prefill bypass annotations, native trace fields and
arbitrary sampling overrides remain unsupported. Expressible unsupported
inputs receive explicit rejection tests. Native messages cannot expose missing
cached-token, expert-tensor or thinking-token fields. GPU work release and KV
transfer require the separate native integration evidence.

## Current local commands

Use Rust 1.96.1, protoc 30.2 and an external `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`. Set `PROTOC` and
`PROTOC_INCLUDE` to that compiler and its matching includes. From the repository
root, list or run all common/vLLM library tests, including the broader
fake-server suite:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-common -p dynamo-vllm-sidecar --lib -- --list
cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-common -p dynamo-vllm-sidecar --lib
```

The vLLM crate enables common's `tonic-v14` feature through its dependency,
so these combined commands need no extra feature flag. A common-only run needs
`--features tonic-v14` for that transport implementation. There is no Python
runner, unit manifest or container export. Record names, failures and ignored cases
when validating a new revision. Wire-preservation commands are in
[COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md).

## Validation

### Unit boundary after lane-marker removal (`40c329fe2b`)

`cargo test --locked -p dynamo-sidecar-common -p dynamo-vllm-sidecar --all-targets`
passed 122 tests: 13 common and 108 vLLM library cases, plus one executable
integration case; zero failed or ignored. The compiled library inventory
matches the prior 121 cases exactly after removing terminal lane markers.
Mechanical transformation and formatting preserve all 82 isolated scenario
bodies. `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and targeted common/vLLM Clippy with
warnings denied passed. The full workspace, GitHub CI and native-engine/GPU
suites were not run for this change. These results validate the #15243 unit
boundary, not the subsequent #15091 restack.

### Historical runner/fixture cleanup (`2dc7efd3f8`)

Before lane-marker removal, the common/vLLM library binaries passed all 121
tests: 13 common and 108 vLLM, with zero failures or ignored tests. Their compiled
inventory retained all 81 prior marked scenarios and added the migrated LoRA
case, for 82 isolated units. Before its removal, the CPU-container workflow step was executed locally
and passed all 82 with `--network none`; this remains historical validation,
not a recurring CI check. All eight testkit conformance cases also passed.

`cargo fmt --all -- --check` passed. A deliberately misformatted copy of the
request suite failed rustfmt, confirming that it formats the new macro syntax.
Targeted common/vLLM/testkit Clippy passed with warnings denied, and pre-commit
hooks passed on all cleanup files.
A temporary Cargo workspace verified pre-merge/post-merge exclusions, nightly
selection and unchanged arguments for custom test harnesses. Independent source
review found no changed test assertions or production behavior. This validation
does not validate the subsequent lane-marker removal or include a full Dynamo
workspace run, GitHub CI or native-engine/GPU execution.

### Historical local-unit draft (`2f6224d332`)

Validation at `2f6224d332`, before the runner/fixture cleanup, confirmed that all
81 scenarios and lane assignments were retained. Moving ten cases from shared to native changes their
reported category and module paths, not their assertions.

| Selection | Historical result at `2f6224d332` |
| --- | --- |
| Compiled inventory | Exact scenario/lane parity: 11 common and 70 native vLLM cases, all `pre_merge`. |
| Exported runner | All 81 isolated units passed. |
| Complete common/vLLM library binaries | All 121 passed: 13 common and 108 vLLM, including the 81 isolated units. |
| Retained integration suites | Eight testkit conformance, four SGLang Mocker and four vLLM Mocker tests passed. |
| Temporary runner checks | Five checks passed, including real Rust lane filtering and a synthetic workspace with custom/legacy targets. |
| CPU container | All 81 units passed with `--network none`, `--read-only`, `--cap-drop=ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges` and a read-only exported-artifact mount. |
| Static checks | `cargo fmt --all --check`, pre-commit on all task files (including Black/Ruff), and CODEOWNERS coverage for new paths passed. |
| Targeted Clippy | Common, vLLM and testkit packages passed with `--all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`. |
| Source review | Independent review found no lost assertions across all 81 cases; this is review evidence, separate from execution. |

These historical results do not validate the current local cleanup or claim
current-head GitHub CI, a full Dynamo workspace run, or native-engine/GPU execution.

### Historical original-PR boundary (`47ae1fb270`)

The following results were recorded before this alternative relocated the unit
sources. They establish the original PR's baseline only.

| Selection | Executed result |
| --- | --- |
| Compiled inventory and exported runner | 81 passed: 11 common, 10 shared vLLM instances and 60 native cases; zero failed or ignored. |
| Complete common/vLLM library suites | 121 passed: 13 common and 108 vLLM; zero failed or ignored. This includes the 81 isolated units. |
| Retained integration suites | Eight testkit conformance, four vLLM Mocker and four SGLang Mocker tests passed. |
| CPU container | All 81 units passed in `sidecar-restack-unit:latest`, with `--network none`, read-only root and artifact mount, and `--cap-drop ALL`. |
| Static checks | `cargo fmt --all --check`, runner Black and Ruff checks passed. |
| Targeted Clippy | Common, vLLM and testkit packages passed with `--all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings`. |

The permanent runner self-tests and their CI invocation have been removed. Five
one-time checks passed from a temporary copy: inventory validation, export
completeness, CLI compatibility, compiled Rust lane selection and workspace
execution with later-lane failures and a custom benchmark. These small Rust
programs do not constitute a full-workspace Dynamo run. This validation does not
claim current-head GitHub CI or full-workspace execution.

### Previous shared-framework boundary (`0857c0722e`)

Before consolidation and adapter removal, `0857c0722e` passed 81 units
(11 common, 28 shared vLLM instances and 42 native cases), including a
network-isolated CPU run. Its 121 common/vLLM library tests, eight conformance
cases and both four-case Mocker suites also passed. These historical results
belong to that previous structure; neither they nor the `47ae1fb270` table
validate this alternative.

### Previous unit boundary

At the previous boundary `b3ab1638`, on foundation `286d6fd5`, the 2026-09-22
record reports **62 isolated cases (11 common, 51 vLLM)** passing in a CPU
container with external networking disabled, zero failed or ignored. Its eight
shared foundation cases and 102 complete common/vLLM library cases also passed
(13 common, 89 vLLM); those selections overlap. Both unchanged four-case Mocker
suites passed independently, and targeted common/vLLM/testkit Clippy passed with
warnings denied. These historical results do not certify subsequent unit
relocations, setup, lane selection or workflow changes.

## Historical execution and failure evidence

The following results belong to the superseded stack on Dynamo base
`cdcd721e72fdfd521c93f35c7f91745b1f7dd01f`; they do not establish results for the
refreshed main dependencies or new PR heads.

The initial unit implementation collected and executed 61 cases: 11 common and
50 vLLM, all passed with zero failed or ignored. A subsequent complete library
run passed 98 cases: 13 common (11 isolated and 2 transport) and 85 vLLM
(50 isolated and 35 socket). These selections overlap; their totals must not be
added. The common/vLLM executions took 0.10/0.15 seconds.

The independent second-PR snapshot was built on historical wire commit
`73192d69351b51763a018edc75b7ec275d9fa68a`, without the third PR's runtime or
process changes. Its first CPU container ran 109 collected cases: 61 isolated,
9 wire scenarios, 2 retained vLLM Mocker, 2 common transport and 35 vLLM socket
cases. This historical snapshot had already applied wire migrations that are
now reserved for #15091, so its retained-suite counts do not describe #15089.

The final G5 case,
`engine::unit_worker::draft_updates_require_both_native_capabilities`, checks
absent metadata, every draft/transfer flag combination, exact advertisement and
rejection before native-client access. It passed, bringing the historical
isolated suite to 62 cases (11 common, 51 vLLM). The final CPU container passed
all 62 with zero failed or ignored. Including that snapshot's 48 wire/retained
cases, historical #15089 at `10456cb1397acfe5cd9bafdf8e3bfd5369a1c12c` executed
110 cases. Its [Pre Merge run](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/actions/runs/35414971016)
and [full PR run](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/actions/runs/35414973825)
passed on that exact head. Containers had external networking disabled and no
GPU devices, model cache or inference-engine installation.

Four initial assertion failures exposed three production defects: system-only
stop reasons leaked; aborted prefill required or published success handoff; and
effective block metadata was ignored, including an unrepresentable value.
Regression fixes retain exact assertions. A separate JSON expectation assumed
sorted keys despite insertion-order serialization; correcting the expected
order fixed that harness defect without changing production.

| Temporary production mutation | Assertion that failed, then passed after restoration |
| --- | --- |
| Swap presence/frequency penalty fields | `convert::unit_requests::representative_request_preserves_all_supported_native_fields` |
| Increment emitted token IDs | `convert::unit_responses::empty_messages_and_delta_tokens_preserve_terminal_usage` |
| Map Unavailable to Unknown | `error::unit_common::maps_transport_statuses_to_backend_errors` |

Each historical mutation compiled and failed its targeted assertion; restored
sources passed and no mutation remains. These observations motivate the
regressions; they are not a new mutation run on the refreshed stack. Existing
Python coverage was not executed by the unit commands above. Counts describe
observed cases, not acceptance quotas or full legacy Python parity.
